Hi I am Mostafa akram, A full-stack developer at 34ML located in Cairo, Egypt.

At 34ML I work on creating web and mobile apps using Laravel, Swift and VueJs. 

I have published this blog to write technical posts about software development including topics about Laravel, CI, Swift, Hosting and others. 

This was build with [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.co/) from [Tighten.co](https://tighten.co/) and this is the template blog generated - my design skills are not the best - I have also used [Nelify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy it from [Github](https://github.com/mostafakram/mostafakram.dev). 

Head to the [About](/about) section to know more about me and feel free to [Contact me](/contact) and chat about anything
